# Web Content Chunker Enhancement Status
Last Updated: 2025-09-15

## Current Status
- **Branch:** `feature/enhanced-chunking` (active)
- **Stable Tag:** `v1.0.0-stable` (fallback point)
- **Stage:** Planning complete, ready to implement

## Completed Setup
✅ Created stable version tag (`v1.0.0-stable`)
✅ Created feature branch (`feature/enhanced-chunking`)
✅ Pushed both to GitHub
✅ Established rollback strategy

## Enhancement Plan (from Chonkie analysis)

### Phase 1: Core Backend Improvements
1. ⏳ Add chunk size control (Small: 100-200, Medium: 200-500, Large: 500-1000 words)
2. ⏳ Smart chunk merging for fragments under 50 words
3. ⏳ Enhanced content extraction (code blocks, tables)
4. ⏳ Improved text cleaning and deduplication
5. ⏳ Add metadata (word counts, positions)

### Phase 2: Minimal UI Additions
6. ⏳ Chunk size slider (3 options)
7. ⏳ Advanced Options toggle
8. ⏳ Overlap control (0-50 words, in Advanced)
9. ⏳ Format selector (JSON/Markdown/Plain, in Advanced)

### Phase 3: Output Processing
10. ⏳ Format conversion functions
11. ⏳ Token counting for LLM usage
12. ⏳ Testing with various website types

## Key Files
- **Main chunking logic:** `/api/chunk.js`
- **UI:** `/public/index.html`
- **Styles:** `/getchunks-styles.css`

## Testing Workflow
1. Local: `npm run serve` → http://localhost:8080
2. Commit to feature branch
3. Vercel preview URL auto-generates
4. Test thoroughly before merging to main

## Rollback Commands
- Quick revert: `git revert <commit>`
- Full rollback: `git checkout main && git reset --hard v1.0.0-stable`
- View tag: `git show v1.0.0-stable`

## Next Steps
1. Start with backend chunk size implementation in `/api/chunk.js`
2. Add word counting function
3. Test locally before adding UI controls

## Design Decisions
- Keep UI minimal (one main control, advanced section hidden)
- Backend improvements are priority
- Maintain Search Influence branding
- No unnecessary complexity

## Notes
- Inspired by Chonkie library's modular approach
- Focus on practical improvements without over-engineering
- Preserve current clean, professional design
